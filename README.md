Abstract:
EFDIN (Extra Food Distribution and Interconnection Network) is a pioneering online platform dedicated to combating food wastage by facilitating the redistribution of surplus food resources. With a primary focus on reducing food waste at its source, EFDIN serves as a dynamic hub where individuals and businesses can share information about excess food items and connect with potential recipients in need.
The core functionality of EFDIN's user-friendly website empowers users, including hotels, wedding malls, supermarkets, and individuals, to list surplus food items with detailed descriptions such as photographs, quantities, prices, and food types. Furthermore, the platform enables users to add new surplus food items to the listing, ensuring real-time updates and an expansive inventory of available resources.
EFDIN operates on the principle of leveraging technology to mitigate food wastage while simultaneously addressing issues of hunger and food insecurity within communities. By providing a centralized platform for efficient food redistribution, EFDIN promotes sustainable practices and fosters a culture of social responsibility among its users. Through collaborative efforts and widespread participation, EFDIN aims to create a future where surplus food resources are optimally utilized to benefit individuals, businesses, and the environment, ultimately contributing to the global effort to combat food wastage.
